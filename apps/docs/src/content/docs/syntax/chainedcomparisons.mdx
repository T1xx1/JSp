Chained comparisons let you concatenate multiple comparisons into single expression without the need of the `&&` gate.

<Diff>
	```ts
	const one = 1;
	const two = 2;
	const three = 3;

    if (one < two < three) {
    	console.log('Two is between one and three');
    }

    ```

    ```ts
    const one = 1;
    const two = 2;
    const three = 3;

    if (one < two && two < three) {
    	console.log('Two is between one and three');
    }
    ```

#### JavaScript

Technically, the chained comparison syntax can be parsed by JavaScript, but it wouldn't work as expected.

```js
const one = 1;
const ten = 10;
const three = 3;

console.log(one < ten < three); // true
```

Since in a chained comparison expression all the operators have the same [precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence), JavaScript will parse the expression from left to right. The comparison operators `>`,`<`,`>=` and `<=` are binary operators, so they evaluate the comparison only between two values at a time. JavaScript will parse the expression like this `(one < ten) < three`

```js
const one = 1;
const two = 2;
const three = 3;

one < ten; // true
true < three; // it's still true because true is coerced into 1 and 1 < 3 is true
```

But obviously 10 is not between 1 and 3.

#### TypeScript

TypeScript will throw a type error if you try to chain comparisons:

```ts
if (1 < 10 < 3) {
	//~~~~~~~~~~ • Operator '<' cannot be applied to types 'boolean' and 'number'. ts(2365)
}
```
