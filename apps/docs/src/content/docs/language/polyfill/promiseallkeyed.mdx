Object-based counterparts to `Promise.all` and `Promise.allSettled`. Instead of accepting an array of promises and returning an array of results, they accept a record of promises and return a record of results under the same keys.

### `Promise.allKeyed(promises)`

Resolves when all promises in the record have resolved, returning a record with the same keys mapped to their resolved values. Rejects immediately if any promise rejects.

```ts
const result = await Promise.allKeyed({
  user: fetchUser(),
  settings: fetchSettings(),
  notifications: fetchNotifications(),
});

result.user          // → resolved User
result.settings      // → resolved Settings
result.notifications // → resolved Notification[]
```

Rejects immediately if any promise rejects, just like `Promise.all`:

```ts
await Promise.allKeyed({
  a: Promise.resolve(1),
  b: Promise.reject(new Error("failed")),
});
// ✗ Error: failed
```

### `Promise.allSettledKeyed(promises)`

```ts
const result = await Promise.allSettledKeyed({
  user: fetchUser(),
  settings: fetchSettings(),
  notifications: fetchNotifications(),
});

if (result.user.status === "fulfilled") {
  console.log(result.user.value);
} else {
  console.error(result.user.reason);
}
```

## `allKeyed` vs `allSettledKeyed`

| | Rejects early | Result type |
|---|---|---|
| `allKeyed` | ✅ yes | `Awaited<T>` |
| `allSettledKeyed` | ❌ no | `PromiseSettledResult<Awaited<T>>` |

Use `allKeyed` when all results are required to proceed. Use `allSettledKeyed` when you want to handle each outcome independently.
