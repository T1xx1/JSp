Chained comparisons let you concatenate multiple comparisons into a single expression without the need of the `&&` gate.

<Support support={frontmatter.support} />

:::caution
This syntax affects JavaScript original behaviour.
:::

<Diff>
	```ts
	const one = 1;
	const two = 2;
	const three = 3;

	one == two == three; // false
	one != two != three; // true

	one === two === three; // false
	one !== two !== three; // true

	one < two < three; // true
	one <= two <= three; // true

	one > two > three; // false
	one >= two >= three; // false
    ```

    ```ts
    const one = 1;
    const two = 2;
    const three = 3;

    one == two && two == three; // false
    one != two && two != three; // true

    one === two && two === three; // false
    one !== two && two !== three; // true

    one < two && two < three; // true
    one <= two && two <= three; // true

    one > two && two > three; // false
    one >= two && two >= three; // false
    ```

</Diff>

With expressions

<Diff>
	```ts
	const arr = [0, 1, 2, 3];

	arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2]; // false
	arr[0] != arr[1] != arr[2]; // true

	arr[0] === arr[1] === arr[2]; // false
	arr[0] !== arr[1] !== arr[2]; // true

	arr[0] < arr[1] < arr[2]; // true
	arr[0] <= arr[1] <= arr[2]; // true

	arr[0] > arr[1] > arr[2]; // false
	arr[0] >= arr[1] >= arr[2]; // false
    ```

    ```ts
    const arr = [0, 1, 2, 3];

    arr[0] == arr[1] && arr[1] == arr[2]; // false
    arr[0] != arr[1] && arr[1] != arr[2]; // true

    arr[0] === arr[1] && arr[1] === arr[2]; // false
    arr[0] !== arr[1] && arr[1] !== arr[2]; // true

    arr[0] < arr[1] && arr[1] < arr[2]; // true
    arr[0] <= arr[1] && arr[1] <= arr[2]; // true

    arr[0] > arr[1] && arr[1] > arr[2]; // false
    arr[0] >= arr[1] && arr[1] >= arr[2]; // false
    ```

</Diff>

You can also chain more than 3 operators and different operators together:

<Diff>
	```ts
	const a = 1;
	const b = 2;
	const c = 3;

	a == b < c <= b; // false
	a >= b !== c; // false
    ```

    ```ts
    const a = 1;
    const b = 2;
    const c = 3;

    a == b && b < c && c <= b; // false
    a >= b && b !== c; // false
    ```

</Diff>

:::caution
Chained comparisons will be transformed into a standard chained `&&` condition, so avoid using heavy computations in the middle operands as they will be evaluated two or more times.

```ts
// ❌ Avoid
const heavyFunction = () => {
	// ...

	return 2;
}

const a = 1;
const c = 3;

a < heavyFunction() < c; // true

// ✅ Do
const heavyFunction = () => {
	// ...

	return 2;
}

const a = 1;
const b = heavyFunction();
const c = 3;

a < b < c; // true
```

## Support

This syntax already exists in JavaScript

#### JavaScript

Technically, chained comparison syntax be parsed by JavaScript, but it wouldn't work as expected.

```js
const one = 1;
const ten = 10;
const three = 3;

console.log(one < ten < three); // true
```

Since in a chained comparison expression, all the operators have the same [precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence), JavaScript will parse the expression from left to right. The operators `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` are binary operators, so they evaluate the comparison only between two values at a time. JavaScript will parse the expression like this `(one < ten) < three`

```js
const one = 1;
const ten = 10;
const three = 3;

one < ten; // true
true < three; // it's still true because true is coerced into 1 and 1 < 3 is true
```

But obviously 10 is not between 1 and 3.

#### TypeScript

TypeScript will throw a type error if you try to chain comparisons:

```ts
if (1 < 10 < 3) {
	//~~~~~~~~~~ • Operator '<' cannot be applied to types 'boolean' and 'number'. ts(2365)
}
```

### Integration

This syntax is integrated with a custom Babel plugin.
